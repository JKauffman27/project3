  <h1>My Top 5 Movies</h1>

  <section id="oceans11">
    <h3>1.) Ocean's 11</h3>
    <img src="images/oceans11.png" alt="Ocean's 11 Movie Poster">
    <p>Personal Score: 8.5/10</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong></p>
    <iframe width="400" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cfu9s89C-pc" title="Clair de lune (Ocean&#39;s Eleven)" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> I mostly love this movie for the overall atmosphere it creates. The music, the character interactions, and just the overall mood of the setting being a classy casino in Vegas. The dynamics of the estranged cast of characters only adds to my overall enjoyment. While I rate it lower than some of the other films on this list, it is mostly due to how many times I have seen this movie.</p>

  <section id="silentvoice">
    <h3>2.) A Silent Voice</h3> 
    <img src="images/silentvoice.png" alt="A Silent Voice Movie Poster">
    <p>Personal Score: 9/10</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong></p>
    <iframe width="400" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EroLWpDFfzs" title="A Silent Voice ending scene Full HD" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> One of the only movies to ever genuinely almost make me cry. I resonated a lot with a majority of the emotions in this film, with the biggest takeaway being that you must always love yourself. This movie has stuck with me ever since I watched it, and I cannot recommend watching it more than this.</p>

  <section id="walle">
    <h3>3.) Wall-E</h3>
    <img src="images/walle.png" alt="Wall-E Movie Poster">
    <p>Personal Score: 10/10</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong></p>
    <iframe width="400" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NPW3mvAN0Rc" title="Wall-E: Define Dancing HQ" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> I will not be accepting any arguments. Wall-E is a cinematic masterpiece and there is no contender. That is all.</p>

  <section id="spiderverse">
    <h3>4.) Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
    <img src="images/spiderman.png" alt="Miles Morales Spider-Man Movie Poster">
    <p>Personal Score: 8.5/10</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong></p>
    <iframe width="400" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJ-FWTLJRdQ" title="Spider Man: Into The Spider Verse (2018) | Miles Finds out Uncle Aaron is The Prowler, Aaron dies." allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> While it is the first one, I would group both movies together under the same score. Personally, however, I love the original more than the sequel mostly for all of the portrayal of characters. Not to mention the emotional impact that hits you literally into the first quarter of the movie when (SPOILER) the original Peter Parker dies. Such a masterclass of cinematic experience brought down in score only for the short runtime and the somewhat-rushed storyline.</p>

  <section id="darkknight">
    <h3>5.) The Dark Knight</h3>
    <img src="images/batman.png" alt="Dark Knight Movie Poster">
    <p>Personal Score: 8.5/10</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong></p>
    <iframe width="400" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppOVLojanC8" title="The Dark Knight (2008) - Joker&#39;s Magic Trick Scene | Movieclips" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Still to this day, I believe that this is the best hero-genre movie ever made. While the most recent Batman movie is definitely a contender, it is not enough to dethrone one of the best Joker actors ever. Rest in peace Heath Ledger.</p>

  <section id="hachi">
    <h3>Bonus Recommendation: Hachi</h3>
    <img src="images/hachi.png" alt="Hachi Dog Movie Poster"> 
    <p>Personal Score: 9/10</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Scene:</strong></p>
    <iframe width="400" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEOB9V8PwYo" title="Hachiko - Ending Scene" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> I have only ever seen this movie once, and it is still the hardest movie to sit through. I burst into unapologetic tears. This one hurts, but in that really, REALLY heartwrenching sort of way. Incredible movie.</p>
